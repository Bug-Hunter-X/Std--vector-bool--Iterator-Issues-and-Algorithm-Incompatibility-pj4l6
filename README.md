# std::vector<bool> Iterator Issues and Algorithm Incompatibility
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue with using `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  The specialized implementation of `std::vector<bool>` uses a bit for each boolean value instead of a full byte. This optimization, while space-saving, leads to incompatibility with standard algorithms and iterator-based operations that assume a byte-per-element layout.  The `bug.cpp` file showcases this problem with a simple example using `std::find()`.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file offers a solution using `std::vector<char>` (or another appropriate container) to resolve the issue.
